As you know, the University of Ottawa is a bilingual institution which means that most courses are offered in both English and French and must be evaluated in the same way. This means that there are a lot of assignments, exams, websites and so on to be translated from English to French. The purpose of this assignment is to see how much of this translation you are able to automate using Perl in order to help professors manage this challenge.
